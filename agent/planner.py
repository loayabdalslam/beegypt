        Create a comprehensive software development plan for the following project:

        PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
        {project_description}

        Your response should have TWO PARTS:

        PART 1: PROJECT PLAN
        Create a structured plan with the following sections:

        1. Project Overview:
           - Main objectives
           - Key features
           - Target users/audience

        2. Technical Architecture:
           - Recommended technologies and frameworks
           - System architecture diagram (describe in text)
           - Data models and relationships

        3. Development Phases:
           - Phase 1: Setup and foundation
           - Phase 2: Core functionality
           - Phase 3: Additional features
           - Phase 4: Testing and refinement

        4. Implementation Details:
           - Directory structure
           - Key files and their purposes
           - External dependencies

        5. Testing Strategy:
           - Unit testing approach
           - Integration testing approach
           - Manual testing requirements

        6. Deployment Considerations:
           - Recommended deployment platform
           - Configuration requirements
           - CI/CD pipeline suggestions

        PART 2: DEVELOPMENT TASKS
        Create a list of specific, actionable development tasks. For each task, provide:
        1. Task ID (numeric)
        2. Task name (short, descriptive)
        3. Description (detailed explanation)
        4. Estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)
        5. Dependencies (IDs of tasks that must be completed first)
        6. Category (Setup, Backend, Frontend, Testing, Deployment, etc.)

        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR TASKS:
        - DO NOT include tasks that use external code generators like 'create-react-app', 'npx create-next-app', etc.
        - Instead, create tasks for manually writing all necessary code files
        - Include tasks for creating configuration files (package.json, webpack.config.js, etc.) manually
        - Only include commands for necessary package installations (npm install, pip install, etc.)
        - Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks for creating a complete project structure

        Format each task as follows:

        Task ID: 1
        Task name: Example task name
        Description: Detailed description of the task
        Estimated complexity: Low/Medium/High
        Dependencies: None or comma-separated IDs
        Category: Category name

        Provide at least 5-10 tasks that cover the entire development process.

        IMPORTANT: You have to take the answer that came to you and do not rush the matter, do not rush the response and do not rush your algorithms. Take your time and answer very calmly.
